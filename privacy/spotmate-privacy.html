                <p>This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of
                    Your
                    information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law
                    protects
                    You.</p>
                <p>At SpotMate, we prioritize your privacy. Currently, we do not collect any personal data. The only
                    features that would involve data collection are iCloud sync and syncing with the Apple Contacts app,
                    which are not yet implemented in the app.</p>

                <h2>Interpretation and Definitions</h2>
                <h3>Interpretation</h3>

                    conditions. The following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear

                <h3>Definitions</h3>
                <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:</p>

                    <li><strong>Personal Data</strong> is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable

                    <li><strong>Service Provider</strong> means any natural or legal person who processes the data on
                        behalf of

                        the Service, to provide the Service on behalf of the Company, to perform services related to the

                </ul>

                <h2>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h2>
                <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
                <h4>Personal Data</h4>
                <p>Currently, SpotMate does not collect any personal data from its users. The app does not collect any
                    personal information unless the iCloud sync or Apple Contacts syncing features are enabled, which
                    are
                    not yet implemented.</p>

                <h4>Information Regarding iCloud Sync and Apple Contacts Sync</h4>
                <p>Once implemented, iCloud sync will allow SpotMate users to sync their data across devices using the
                    same
                    Apple ID. This feature would involve syncing contact data between SpotMate and iCloud, but at
                    present,
                    it is not yet available.</p>
                <p>Additionally, we may need to request access to the Apple Contacts app to sync contacts between the
                    app
                    and the contacts stored on your device. This feature would allow for easier management of contacts
                    within
                    SpotMate, but like iCloud sync, it has not yet been implemented.</p>
                <p>Please note that these features will only collect and sync data if they are enabled. Until then,
                    SpotMate
                    does not access or collect any personal data.</p>

                <h2>Use of Your Personal Data</h2>
                <p>Since SpotMate currently does not collect any personal data, we do not use any personal data in any
                    way.
                    When the iCloud sync and Apple Contacts syncing features are implemented, we will use the data
                    solely
                    for the purposes of syncing and managing your contacts. No other personal data will be used by the
                    app
                    at this time.</p>

                <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app, the addition of
                    new
                    features (such as iCloud sync and Apple Contacts syncing), or legal requirements. Any changes will
                    be
                    reflected in an updated version of this Privacy Policy, which will be made available within the app
                    and
                    on our website.</p>
                <p>As we do not currently collect any personal data, there will be no need for us to notify users
                    directly
                    about changes to this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay
                    informed about how we are protecting your information. The most recent version of this Privacy
                    Policy
                    will always be available in the app and on our website.</p>
